# Blackjack Simulator

This is a basic blackjack simulator built with Python.

The game follows these rules:

- Dealer stands on 17
- Blackjack pays 3/2

## Next Steps

- The split and double down logic is incomplete and needs fixing
- Build interactive UI instead of console
- Implement some form of card counting strategy
